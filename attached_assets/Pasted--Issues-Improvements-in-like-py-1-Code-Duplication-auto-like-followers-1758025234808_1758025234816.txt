1. **Code Duplication**

   * `auto_like_followers` and `auto_like_following` are almost identical.
   * You could merge them into one function with a parameter (`"followers"` or `"following"`) to avoid repeating \~70% of the code.

2. **Rate-Limiting / Human-like behavior**

   * Currently you `time.sleep(random.uniform(5,15))` after *each like*.
   * This is predictable and may still look automated. You should vary **longer pauses between users**, and not just between likes.

3. **Error Handling**

   * You catch `ClientError` and then `time.sleep(60)`. But if it‚Äôs a **permanent ban/403 block**, sleeping won‚Äôt fix it.
   * You should detect the error code/message and handle:

     * **429 Too Many Requests** ‚Üí Back off longer.
     * **403 Forbidden / Block** ‚Üí Stop task & notify admin.

4. **Database Inefficiency**

   * For each media you query: `fetch_db("SELECT 1 ...")`.
   * This means N queries per user ‚Üí very inefficient.
   * Instead, fetch all `liked_posts` for that user in one go and check in memory.

5. **Missing Proxy / IP Rotation**

   * All requests go from one IP. Instagram may detect automation faster.
   * Should include proxy support or session rotation.

6. **Silent Failures**

   * In some `except Exception`, you just `continue` without alerting admin/Telegram bot.
   * You may want real-time reporting of errors.

7. **Logging**

   * `log.info("Liked media %s")` is fine, but maybe add structured logs (user, timestamp, total likes done today) for better monitoring.

## üöÄ Advanced Features You Can Add

Here are features that will make this bot much smarter and safer:

1. **Smart Like Strategy**

   * Instead of liking random N posts, use filters:

     * Only like posts from last X days.
     * Avoid reels or IGTV.
     * Skip posts already having too many likes (to look more natural).


2. **Daily & Hourly Caps**

   * Right now you only check daily cap.
   * Instagram usually bans if likes exceed \~200/hour or \~1000/day.
   * Add per-hour caps and randomized breaks.

3. **Multi-Account Support**

   * Allow the bot to run for multiple Instagram accounts with separate DB sessions.

4. **Telegram Bot Integration**

   * Send real-time updates to Telegram:

     * "Liked 3 posts from @username"
     * "‚ö† Daily cap reached"
     * "‚ùå Blocked from liking for 24 hours"

5. **Scheduling / Cron-like Feature**

   * Instead of running nonstop, schedule likes at specific times (morning, evening) to look human.

6. **Whitelist / Blacklist**

   * Whitelist users ‚Üí always like their posts.
   * Blacklist users ‚Üí never like their posts.

7. **Auto-Unlike (Optional)**

   * Option to unlike posts after X days, to reduce footprint.

8. **Parallel Actions with Queues**

    * Instead of `time.sleep` inside loops (blocking), implement a task queue system with asyncio or threading so multiple actions (like + story view + comment) can run smoothly.


## üîé Issues & Improvements in follow.py

### 1. **Code Duplication**

1.* `auto_follow_targeted` and `auto_follow_location` are **90% identical** (loop logic, DB checks, caps, sleeps).
* You could merge into a single `auto_follow(source="hashtag"/"location")` function and just swap the media-fetching logic.

---

 2. **Rate-Limiting / Human-like behavior**

* Current sleeps (`10‚Äì30s` for follow, `10‚Äì20s` for unfollow) are predictable.
* Instagram‚Äôs detection systems look for *patterns*.

  * Should add:

    * **randomized long gaps** after every X follows/unfollows.
    * **breaks across hours** instead of continuous activity.

---

### 3. **Error Handling**

* Like in your `like.py`, you only `time.sleep(60)` after `ClientError`.
* Issues:

  * `429 Too Many Requests` ‚Üí Should back off for 5‚Äì30 min, not 60s.
  * Permanent block ‚Üí should **stop the task** and notify admin.
* Right now, the bot will keep retrying and possibly make things worse.

---

### 4. **Database Inefficiency**

* For every user, you run multiple DB queries (`blacklist_users`, `followed_users`, etc).
* This scales badly when following thousands of users.
* Better:

  * Fetch sets into memory at the start:

    ```python
    blacklist = set(fetch_db("SELECT user_id FROM blacklist_users"))
    already_followed = set(fetch_db("SELECT user_id FROM followed_users"))
    ```
  * Then check with `if user_id in blacklist:` (O(1)).

---

### 5. **Old Follows Cleanup**

* `auto_unfollow_old` uses `followed_at` but assumes DB always has proper timestamps.
* If some rows are missing `followed_at` (corruption, migration, etc.), your query breaks.
* Should fallback with a check.

---

### 6. **Friendship Check Fragility**

* `cl.user_friendship(user_id)` can throw if:

  * User is private.
  * Account was deleted.
* You catch it, but you `continue` silently.
* Suggest logging with a counter for how many were skipped.

---

### 7. **Logging**

* Logs only to file/console.
* Would be useful to push **Telegram notifications** when:

  * Daily cap reached.
  * Block detected.
  * X users followed/unfollowed.

---

## üöÄ Advanced Features You Can Add

### 1. **Follow Strategy Enhancements**

* **Follow filters:**

  * Minimum followers/following ratio (avoid bots).
  * Only public accounts.
  * Skip if account has <3 posts.
  * Skip if last post >6 months old.

* **Weighted follow system:**

  * E.g., prioritize users who post with certain hashtags, or who are followed by mutuals.

---

### 2. **Unfollow Strategy Enhancements**

* Add multiple modes:

  * `unfollow_all_not_following_back` (default).
  * `unfollow_inactive_accounts` (no posts in last 6 months).
  * `unfollow_batch(limit=N)` (to avoid mass unfollow waves).

* Add **delayed unfollow**:

  * Example: Only unfollow after 10‚Äì14 days, not just fixed 7.

---

### 3. **Daily & Hourly Caps**

* Right now: daily caps only.
* Add **hourly caps + cooldowns**. Example:

  * Max 20 follows/hour.
  * Max 150/day.
* If cap reached ‚Üí pause until reset, then auto-resume.

---

### 4. **Scheduling / Smart Timing**

* Spread follow/unfollow across:

  * **peak activity times** (morning, evening local time).
  * Looks much more natural than midnight runs.

---

### 5. **Telegram Integration**

* Send live updates:

  * ‚úÖ "Followed 5 users from #fitness"
  * ‚ö† "Daily follow cap reached"
  * ‚ùå "Instagram blocked follow action, pausing for 1 hour"

---

### 6. **User Segmentation / Lists**

* Maintain **different lists** of users:

  * Whitelist ‚Üí never unfollow.
  * Blacklist ‚Üí never follow.
  * Priority list ‚Üí always follow back if unfollowed.
## üîé Issues & Weaknesses in `story.py`

### 1. **Misleading Functionality**

* Docstring says:

  > *‚Äúdoesn't mark stories as viewed in Instagram‚Äù*
* That means you‚Äôre **not actually viewing** stories, just fetching metadata (`story_info`).
* If your bot is advertised as ‚Äúauto view stories,‚Äù this is **not doing the real action** ‚Äî Instagram doesn‚Äôt expose a clean public method for marking stories as viewed.
* ‚úÖ Solution: clarify naming ‚Üí call it `fetch_story_info` (or if you plan to simulate real views, implement via private endpoints).

---

### 2. **Inefficient User Loop**

* `auto_view_stories` iterates over `users_dict.keys()` but calls DB per-story.
* DB writes happen inside the story loop ‚Üí heavy overhead.
* Should batch commit transactions after processing a user.

---

### 3. **Redundant Code**

* `auto_view_followers_stories` and `auto_view_following_stories` are **identical wrappers** that only differ in `followers_list` vs `following_list`.
* Same duplication problem you had in `follow.py`.
* ‚úÖ Better: create a single function `auto_view(type="followers"/"following")`.

---

### 4. **Rate-Limiting Weakness**

* Sleep is `3‚Äì8s` between story fetches. That‚Äôs too consistent.
* Instagram may flag repetitive intervals.
* Should introduce:

  * **longer random delays after N stories**
  * **hourly limits**, not just daily cap.

---

### 5. **Error Handling**

* After `ClientError`, you only wait `30s`.
* If you hit rate-limit or temp-block, **30s is too short** ‚Äî you‚Äôll just hammer the endpoint again.
* ‚úÖ Add adaptive backoff:

  * 1st error: wait 1 min.
  * 2nd: wait 5 min.
  * 3rd: pause the whole task.


---

### 6. **Logging / Transparency**

* Right now logs just say:

  * `"Fetched story info {id}"`.
* For debugging & analytics you‚Äôd want:

  * `"Viewed 12 stories from 5 users in this session"`
  * `"Skipped 8 users (private / no stories)"`.

---

---

## üöÄ Advanced Features to Add

### 1. **Simulate Real Story Views**

* Instead of just fetching `story_info`, simulate the **actual ‚Äúseen‚Äù event** (this requires calling private endpoints ‚Äî riskier but possible).
* If you want safety ‚Üí keep current metadata fetch but **rename functions** to avoid misleading users.



### 2. **Hourly & Daily Caps**

* Example safe limits:

  * Max 50 story views/hour.
  * Max 200/day.

---

### 3. **Telegram / Admin Alerts**

* Push update after batch:

  * ‚úÖ ‚ÄúViewed 120 stories from 45 users today.‚Äù
  * ‚ö† ‚ÄúDaily cap reached, pausing.‚Äù
  * ‚ùå ‚ÄúInstagram blocked story views, retrying in 1 hour.‚Äù
