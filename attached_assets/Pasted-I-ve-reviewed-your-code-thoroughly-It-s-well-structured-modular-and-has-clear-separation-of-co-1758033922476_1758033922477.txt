I’ve reviewed your code thoroughly. ✅
It’s well-structured, modular, and has clear separation of concerns (rate limiting, filtering, following/unfollowing, DB ops). Logging and error handling are also thoughtfully implemented. Below are my observations and improvement suggestions:

---

### 👍 Strengths

1. **Clean Architecture**

   * `FollowRateLimiter` encapsulates state and logic nicely.
   * Separation of filtering (`should_follow_user`), delays (`get_smart_follow_delay`), and error handling (`handle_follow_client_error`) is good.

2. **Error Handling**

   * Uses exponential backoff for rate-limiting errors.
   * Differentiates between fatal (`403/blocked`) vs. retryable (`429/too many requests`) errors.

3. **Database & Cache Usage**

   * Loads blacklist and followed users into sets for O(1) lookups.
   * Updates DB after every action — good for resilience if script is interrupted.

4. **Human-Like Behavior**

   * Smart delays, randomness, and extra pauses reduce bot-like patterns.
   * Skip reasons are tracked and summarized — useful for debugging.

5. **Scalability**

   * Functions like `auto_follow_from_source` and `auto_unfollow_old` are generalized enough to extend later.

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

#### 1. Rate Limiter Reset Duplication

```python
if now >= self.hourly_reset_time:
    self.hourly_follows = 0
    self.hourly_unfollows = 0
    self.hourly_reset_time = now + timedelta(hours=1)
```

This block appears in both `check_hourly_follow_limit` and `check_hourly_unfollow_limit`.
👉 Suggestion: Extract into a private method (`_reset_hourly_if_needed()`).

---

#### 2. Sleeping Inside Logic

Functions like `auto_follow_from_source` and `handle_follow_client_error` use `time.sleep()`. This blocks the whole process.
👉 Consider:

* Moving to **asyncio** (`await asyncio.sleep()`) if you want concurrent tasks.
* Or at least run in a background thread to avoid blocking other bot features.

---

#### 3. Potential Redundant User Processing

You fetch **3x amount** medias:

```python
medias = safe_hashtag_medias_recent(source_identifier, amount=amount * 3)
```

But only follow until `count_followed >= amount`.
👉 Suggestion: Filter early, or explain why 3x oversampling is needed (to counter private/skipped accounts). Otherwise, it’s extra API load.

---

#### 4. Friendships Check Skips Too Aggressively

```python
except Exception as friendship_error:
    users_skipped += 1
    skip_reasons["friendship_check_failed"] = ...
    continue
```

If `user_friendship` fails once (e.g., network glitch), the user is skipped permanently.
👉 Suggestion: Retry once before skipping.

---

#### 5. Hardcoded Limits

Hourly follows/unfollows are hardcoded (15, 20). Same for daily caps.
👉 Suggestion: Make them **configurable** via DB or `.env`.

---

#### 6. DB Efficiency

Every follow/unfollow runs `INSERT OR REPLACE`. On large scale, this might fragment DB.
👉 Suggestion: Use `bulk_insert` batching where possible (after every N operations).

---

#### 7. Telegram Notifications

Currently just logs:

```python
def send_follow_telegram_notification(message: str):
    log.info(f"📱 Follow notification: {message}")
```

👉 Suggestion: Wire it into actual Telegram bot handler (`aiogram` / `python-telegram-bot`) — otherwise these updates get lost.

---

#### 8. Type Hints & Return Types

Some functions return mixed types (`str | None`). Example:

```python
def handle_follow_client_error(...) -> Optional[str]:
```

But sometimes it sleeps + returns `None` (continue), or returns an error string.
👉 Suggestion: Use `Literal["stop", None]` or a custom enum to make control flow explicit.

---

#### 9. Log Verbosity

Some loops log every skip. If you’re processing thousands of medias, logs may blow up.
👉 Suggestion: Log only summary counts of skip reasons, unless `debug` level is enabled.

---

#### 10. Security / Robustness

* Any user input (`source_identifier`, `user_id`) should be sanitized before inserting into DB (to prevent SQL injection if not parameterized).
* Ensure DB schema has proper indexes (`followed_users.user_id`, `blacklist_users.user_id`) for scalability.

### 🚀 Suggested Small Refactor Example

Rate limiter reset refactor:

```python
class FollowRateLimiter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hourly_follows = 0
        self.hourly_unfollows = 0
        self.hourly_reset_time = datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=1)
        self.error_count = 0
        self.last_error_time = None

    def _reset_if_needed(self):
        now = datetime.now()
        if now >= self.hourly_reset_time:
            self.hourly_follows = 0
            self.hourly_unfollows = 0
            self.hourly_reset_time = now + timedelta(hours=1)

    def check_hourly_follow_limit(self, max_per_hour: int = 15) -> bool:
        self._reset_if_needed()
        return self.hourly_follows < max_per_hour

    def check_hourly_unfollow_limit(self, max_per_hour: int = 20) -> bool:
        self._reset_if_needed()
        return self.hourly_unfollows < max_per_hour
```

✅ **Verdict:**
Your code is already **production-quality** for a small-scale bot.
Main improvements: remove duplication, avoid blocking `sleep()`, make limits configurable, and add actual Telegram integration.

Do you want me to **refactor this into an async version** (so follow/unfollow tasks can run in parallel), or keep it sync but optimize blocking points?
